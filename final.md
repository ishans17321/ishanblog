<h1>Final Exam CSSE1</h1>
<h2>5 key things I learned over 12 weeks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>GitHub and VS Code understanding of branches, pull requestss, issues, burndowns, commits, and etc.</li>
    <li>Understanding JS fundamentals such new knowledge such as for loops, arrays, variables, and etc.</li>
    <li>Tools installation, verification, etc.</li>
    <li>Use of .md, .html, and .js and other such file types to successfully make a webpage on my personal repositories</li>
    <li>Collaboration and communication skills for coding projects such as the javascript lessons, and the adventure game</li>
</ul>
<h2>RPG game Tinkers: Note the link is my parter because I committed to his repo</h2>

    font-weight: bold;

    box-shadow: 0 6px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  }
</style>
<ul>
    <li>Change of sprites, background, and the color of chill guy's clothes</li>
    <li>Add of a collision class in which the player cannot move forward and must answer questions to move on</li>
    <li>Changing the position of the sprites to match position in real life</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>RPG Game Tinker Explanation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First tinker - we put our sprites that we created using piskel and chat-GPT into the code of that particular npc </li>
    <li>Second tinker - we created a class called collision which was the same as an NPC but it didn't take the spritesheet but rather has a hitbox in which there would be questions for the player to answer. The collision was layered over a rock in the background.</li>
    <li>Third tinker - we changed the initial position of the sprites but also added another code line of the init position converted into pixels so that you change the sprite location and it would be shown in the game</li>
    <li>Image of ideas for our adventure game level</li>
    <li>We did add some parts of what functions that were said in the diagram such as update(), spriteWidth and spriteHeight for players and NPCs. Some things that we didn't do due to time constraints and my partner goofing off were the movement of the sprites as he was supposed to work on the animation of the sprites.</li>

<h2>N@TM Feedback</h2>
[text](https://github.com/ishans17321/ishanblog/issues/2)
</ul>
<h2>Other Projects I Found Cool</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bathroom Pass</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Smart integration of Student ID into the bathroom pass for efficient student tracking for time taken with the mini computer deploying the data to website.</li>
        <li>Real-time monitoring of duration and time-in/time-out data.</li>
        <li>One piece of feedback for advanced level Rasberry pi: allow the ID to have a chip in which the person could be tracked live time witha map on DNHS.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Aesthetihawk</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves Nighthawk Pages login and looks significantly improved in animation and features</li>
        <li>Customization into websites is excellent as you could see the page working perfectly</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Evan and West's Discord Basement Simulator</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Cool game in which their were two NPC's who helped the player escape out of the basement</li>
        <li>Also had their statsManager file working as answering questions correctly gave the player points to escape</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h2>My Strengths, Weaknesses, and Coding Goals for the Future</h2>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Strong grasp of GitHub and its associated tools.</li>
    <li>Good understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and Markdown form to make a blog/webpage.</li>
    <li>Excellent communication, determination, and the ability to plan goals for future. Also good leadership in teams projects such as the javascript lessons.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Limited ideas imagination in projects and not able to work focused for the entire class. </li>
    <li>Less than great knowledge of JS syntax and debugging errors and applying skills beyond basics</li>
    <li>Less motivation in computer science compared to other classes. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Coding Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Expand game level using above feedback following the plans shown above.</li>
    <li>Win CyberPatriot again</li>
    <li>Acheieve USACO GOLD</li>
    <li>Applying my computer science, python, and javascript skills to make a bigger project such as as another cool game or a customized arduino project or using EV3 for fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Burndowns and Issues</h2>
<p>I created one issue and 2 burndowns on my personal blog. The burndowns were to hep me track my progress on the adventure game and final exam. The issue was for the javascript homework.</p>
<h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
<p>Throughout this course, I have demonstrated a strong understanding of essential tools, GitHub, VS Code, JavaScript, and MD files. My ability to navigate these technologies effectively is evident in my projects and contributions. While I recognize areas for improvement, such as further refining my skills and deepening my understanding of advanced concepts, I am confident in my progress and dedication to growth. Considering both my achievements and areas for development, I would assess my final grade as 0.925/1, reflecting my solid grasp of the material and commitment to continuous learning.</p>---

</ul>
<br>
<h2>N@TM Feedback</h2>
The main points of feedback we recieved fell into one of three main categories (generally speaking)
<ul>
    <li>Adding a plot or story in which the questions would be jungle/forest themed.</li>
    <li>Making sure when you answer a question correctly you would gain a certain amount of increase of balance. Balance would help to escape.</li>
    <li>Animate the characters and increase chill guy's player speed.</li>

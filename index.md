## Who Am I?
I’m currently a freshman with a strong interest in technology and cybersecurity. I enjoy competing in **CyberPatriot**, where I get hands-on experience securing Windows and Linux systems, and tackling complex networking challenges. 

I also dabble in programming for fun, mainly using **Python** and **Java**. Beyond tech, I like to immerse myself in nature—living in the **boreal forest biome** has its perks! 🌲❄️

## Academic Life
Right now, I’m doing my best to balance school life and extracurriculars. My grades are looking solid this term:

- **1 B**
- **1 C**

I aim to improve and strive for academic excellence while honing my technical skills.

CyberPatriot competitions are a highlight for me. Whether it's hardening a server or analyzing threats, I love every aspect of making systems secure.

### Programming 💻
Coding is both a hobby and a skill I’m continuously building. I’ve worked on Python scripts and Java programs, and I enjoy solving challenges to sharpen my problem-solving abilities.
